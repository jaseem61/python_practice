hello, this directory contains the programs related to face recognition.
face_recognition package is used for recognizing face and opencv is used for labelling the face.
One of the fault found in the program is that it can be used to identify only a single face :/.....trying to fix it
in the same directory as code, create two directories. One for known_images and the other is for unknown_images.
in the known_images directory, create a directory with the person name. Inside the person name directory, include some image of the face of that person.
In the unknown_images directory, place a collection of images which may or may not have the "known person" in it.
